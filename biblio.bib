abstract = {In this article a homotopy co-momentum map ($\backslash$`a la Callies-Fr$\backslash$'egier-Rogers-Zambon) trangressing to the standard hydrodynamical co-momentum map of Arnol'd, Marsden and Weinstein and others is constructed and then generalized to a special class of Riemannian manifolds. Also, a covariant phase space interpretation of the coadjoint orbits associated to the Euler evolution for perfect fluids and in particular of Brylinski's manifold of smooth oriented knots is discussed. As an application of the above homotopy co-momentum map, a reinterpretation of the (Massey) higher order linking numbers in terms of conserved quantities within the multisymplectic framework is provided and knot theoretic analogues of first integrals in involution are determined.},

@article{Rogers2010,
abstract = {A manifold is multisymplectic, or more specifically n-plectic, if it is equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential form of degree n+1. In our previous work with Baez and Hoffnung, we described how the `higher analogs' of the algebraic and geometric structures found in symplectic geometry should naturally arise in 2-plectic geometry. In particular, we showed that just as a symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, any 2-plectic manifold gives a Lie 2-algebra of 1-forms and functions. Lie n-algebras are examples of L-infinity algebras: graded vector spaces which are equipped with a collection of skew-symmetric multi-brackets that satisfy a generalized Jacobi identity. Here, we generalize our previous result. Given an n-plectic manifold, we explicitly construct a corresponding Lie n-algebra on a complex consisting of differential forms whose multi-brackets are specified by the n-plectic structure. We also show that any n-plectic manifold gives rise to another kind of algebraic structure known as a differential graded Leibniz algebra. We conclude by describing the similarities between these two structures within the context of an open problem in the theory of strongly homotopy algebras.},

@article{Callies2016,
abstract = {Associated to any manifold equipped with a closed form of degree {\textgreater}1 is an ‘L∞-algebra of observables' which acts as a higher/homotopy analog of the Poisson algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold. In order to study Lie group actions on these manifolds, we introduce a theory of homotopy moment maps. Such a map is a L∞-morphism from the Lie algebra of the group into the observables which lifts the infinitesimal action. We establish the relationship between homotopy moment maps and equivariant de Rham cohomology, and analyze the obstruction theory for the existence of such maps. This allows us to easily and explicitly construct a large number of examples. These include results concerning group actions on loop spaces and moduli spaces of flat connections. Relationships are also established with previous work by others in classical field theory, algebroid theory, and dg geometry. Furthermore, we use our theory to geometrically construct various L∞-algebras as higher central extensions of Lie algebras, in analogy with Kostant's quantization theory. In particular, the so-called ‘string Lie 2-algebra' arises this way.},

@article{Zambon2012,
abstract = {We define a higher analogue of Dirac structures on a manifold M. Under a regularity assumption, higher Dirac structures can be described by a foliation and a (not necessarily closed, non-unique) differential form on M, and are equivalent to (and simpler to handle than) the Multi-Dirac structures recently introduced in the context of field theory by Vankerschaver, Yoshimura and Marsden. We associate an L-infinity algebra of "observables" to every higher Dirac structure, extending work of Baez, Hoffnung and Rogers on multisymplectic forms. Further, applying a recent result of Getzler, we associate an L-infinity algebra to any manifold endowed with a closed differential form H, via a "higher analogue of Courant algebroid twisted by H". Finally, we study the relations between the L-infinity algebras appearing above.},

@article{Ryvkin2016,
abstract = {Given a vector field on a manifold {\$}M{\$} , we define a globally conserved quantity to be a differential form whose Lie derivative is exact. Integrals of conserved quantities over suitable submanifolds are constant under time evolution, the Kelvin circulation theorem being a well-known special case. More generally, conserved quantities are well behaved under transgression to spaces of maps into {\$}M{\$} . We focus on the case of multisymplectic manifolds and Hamiltonian vector fields. Our main result is that in the presence of a Lie group of symmetries admitting a homotopy co-momentum map, one obtains a whole family of globally conserved quantities. This extends a classical result in symplectic geometry. We carry this out in a general setting, considering several variants of the notion of globally conserved quantity.},
